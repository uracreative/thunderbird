The Photon Design System provides a centralized, living source for look, feel and sound of our products to create consistent user interfaces across all Firefox products. It collects guidelines, reusable UI components, templates and other resources to help you focus on the unique parts of your work.

## ðŸŒ± Help us grow Photon

With your help we will review any new UI to ensure Photon stays up to date, new components are added and existing ones are updated.

If you are missing information in Photon, please [file an issue](https://github.com/FirefoxUX/photon/issues) for it. This can be a component you notice that is not specified or a type of information that would make your work more productive.
