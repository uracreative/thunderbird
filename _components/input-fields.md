## Copy Rules

### Input Fields Messages

* Prioritize brevity over niceties. Don't say please. Just tell people what to do. "Choose a number that is less than..."

* Be as specific as possible in the message. "Choose a date" or "Choose a time" or "Enter an address” are all better than “Enter a value.”

* Speak to users’ cognitive processes instead of their tactile ones where possible. Use words like “choose” or “select” instead of “type” or “key”. We'd rather engage users' minds than their hands, and this also speaks more universally to users accessing the Web with touchscreens, speech-recognition software, or other user input devices.

* If there are programmatic rules governing valid choices, expose these in the messages where possible. Don't just tell someone that X is the nearest valid value, tell them that they must choose values in x increments. "Choose times in 30-minute increments from 8:00 am."

### Input Fields Placeholders

* Tell users what objects are going to be searched if possible. “Search + object” is more clear than just saying “Search”.
