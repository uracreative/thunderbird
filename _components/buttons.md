## Copy Rules

* When possible, use labels that describe the action or result of selecting the button. Use the same terms to describe the action in both the button and any supporting instructional copy.

* When using two buttons to present a binary choice, if possible label as "X" and "Don't X". This will also help with localization. 

* Use **ellipses** in buttons when the action requires additional user input, usually via a dialog, an alert or moving the operation to another window or part of the UI.
