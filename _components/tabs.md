Tabs are used to navigate to related destinations.

## Usage

- Don’t use tabs for destinations that are not related. Tabs should be connected by the same information object.
- Don’t load the entire page for tabs. Only the tabs and their content area should be changing when a user switches to another tab. Nothing else, including the position, should be changing. Users should feel like they are in the same place while alternating tabs. 
- Avoid long tab content load time. Tabs should be rapid switching.
- Don’t use multiple rows of tabs as they destroy spatial memory. Tabs should be presented in one row. 
- Don’t order tabs randomly. Order them based on user needs.
- Avoid using tabs for more than 1 navigation level as their relationship may be unclear to users. Tabs should be used for the lowest navigation level on the page. Use tabs for only one navigation level. 
- Don’t use tabs when users need to compare the content behind them.

There are some overlaps between Don'ts and Do's. Haven't which ones to include yet (whether we need both Don'ts and Do's).
