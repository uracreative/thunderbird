![Example of a micro size button in use](../images/buttons/button-micro-example.svg)

Use the micro version when you need to display two different primary actions with different levels of importance. Or when you don't have enough real estate. For example in Firefox Accounts “Skip This Step” has a lower importance compared to “Sign in.”
