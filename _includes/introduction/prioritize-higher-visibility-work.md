*Imagine you're prioritizing how to ship the first iteration of "Bookmarks Management on Mobile" feature. The first step is to tap the "Star" icon. The optional final steps are when the user edits the Name, Location and Keywords before they save their changes.*

*For the first step of tapping the "Star" (which has high visibility), you'll want to align every aspect with the Photon Design System. But for the final steps (which are lower visibility), you can use a full-page system dialog in Android because it's easier to implement and still aligned with the Android platform.*
