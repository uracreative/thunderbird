# thunderbird

This is the repository containing the Thunderbird Style Guide, which is based on [Firefox Photon's Design System](https://design.firefox.com/photon/). The technology used to create this website is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator.

The Firefox Photon system has been modified and adapted for use for Thunderbird. There are some sections hidden from the main view as they are do not apply to Thunderbird meanwhile some sections have been modified slightly, such as links to docs, social accounts etc.
