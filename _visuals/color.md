Thunderbird colors are bold, vibrant and attractive. They enhance the experience by providing visual clues and by bringing attention to primary actions.

### Color Contrast

Follow the [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast) Level AA guidelines to ensure proper color contrast.


#### Color Contrast Values

* **Fail** – Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background.

* **AA Large** – Acceptable contrast for type sizes >= 18px.

* **AA** – Acceptable contrast for text sizes below 18px.

* **AAA** – Enhanced contrast.

### Color Blind

There are different types of color blindness. The most common form is red-green color blindness, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and total color blindness. Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females. Ensure that adjacent color shades are distinguishable for color blind people. Use a color blindness analyzer to confirm your choices.

### High Contrast on Windows

Windows currently offers multiple high contrast modes. Ensure that colors are translated properly, following the hierarchy defined for the default theme.
