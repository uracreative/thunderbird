Thunderbird illustrations are approachable, supportive, and whimsical.

## Usage

Illustrations are a visually and emotionally powerful tool. So use them sparingly and carefully identify the right situations for them. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it may lose its communicative power and distract people. 

Use illustration to encourage users who are frustrated, are lost, or have had something go wrong. Don't use illustration if the user is in danger.

Use illustration to **introduce** and **explain** a product or feature. This can be especially helpful for new, misused, or neglected features.
