Launch recognizable, enjoyable Thunderbird features faster.

Photon is the Firefox design language to build modern, intuitive, delightful experiences, for products across all platforms – from mobile to desktop, from TV to the next big thing.

The Photon Design System houses guidelines, reusable UI components, templates, and other resources to help you create products for Thunderbird users. It is flexible and always evolving to serve the best Thunderbird experience for every situation.

Using this system will help make your work more efficient, and our products more consistent, while still looking, feeling, and sounding uniquely Thunderbird.

You can help us improve the system and ensure it remains current and relevant.
