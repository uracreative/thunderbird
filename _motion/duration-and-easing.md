A rigidly linear movement looks unnatural to the human eye. Accelerate and decelerate smoothly to help your animation feel more natural.

## Duration

Animations should last 150msâ€“250ms and should feel quick and responsive. Shorter animations are also more easily compiled by machines, helping to achieve the sensation of quick responsiveness.


## Easing
